Hi,

If you want to run the code you will need a python enviroment to do this the command is
the ve should not be in the folder there should be a surronding folder with the ve and project
python -m venv [name]
then to activate it 
[name]\Scripts\activate
After you run the VE you need to install django
pip install django
Then all you need to do is 
cd [folder name]
python manage.py runserver
Then CTRL click the link or type http://127.0.0.1:8000/ into your browser

Thanks :)
